# This gem provides a Ruby API for working with Google Voice. Right now
# there is no public API provided by Google, so we are relying on 
# mechanize to log into the site and use some restful web services to
# work with the data. The calls were provided at this pagE:
# http://posttopic.com/topic/google-voice-add-on-development
# and this class will implement all the methods outlined there.
